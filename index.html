                Over 4 years ago I wanted one thing:<p style="color:blue;">A domain of my own</p><br>
				I was lucky enough to have a supportive team for all the projects that i had worked with(Apple+FAB+Etihad),
                and over the years it helped me to grow in the most amazing ways.
            </p>
            <p class="about-section_text text--primary">
                Here I am able to push myself not only as an engineer but also as an explorer and what not Which is all to say:
                Im probably in the process of learning something new, and i hope you are coming along for
                the ride with me!<p style="font-size:100px">&#128540;</p>
