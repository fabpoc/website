                Over 4 years ago I wanted one thing:a domain of my own.<br>
				I was lucky enough to have a supportive apple garage team,
                and over the years it helped me to grow in the most amazing ways.

                Here I am able to push myself as an engineer explorer what not Which is all to say:
                Im probably in the process of learning something new, and you are coming along for
                the ride with me!
